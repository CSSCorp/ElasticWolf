ElasticWolf is an application for managing Amazon Web Services resources with a simple and 
easy to use UI. 

This project is a fork of ElasticFox with support the GovCloud region, much better VPC 
support, and many other enhancements. It is also packaged with all necessary tools and 
utilities to deal with private and public keys and SSL certificates. In short, it provides
everything for an AWS user to get going without using the command line tools.

The Windows version of the tool is packaged with openssl for generating keys and ssh 
clients for accessing Linux instances.

The project has been supported by AWS to deal with new GovCloud services, which are not 
currently supported by the AWS Console.
